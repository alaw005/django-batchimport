Thanks for downloading django-batchimport.

INSTALLATION:
1. Ensure that you have Python 2.5+ installed. 
See http://www.python.org for more information.

2. Ensure that you have Django 1.0+ installed.
See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/ for more
information.

3. Install xlrd.
See http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm for more
information.

4. In the same folder where you found this file is a sample_project folder.
Navigate to it.

5. Open the settings.py file. Change the following settings to your
liking:
   a. Templates folder location (look for "CHANGE_ME!!!" in settings.py).
   b. (Optional) Database type/location. I've got it set up to write 
      a Sqlite3 db to this folder and call it "sample_project.db".

6. Open the batchimport/batchimport_settings.py file.

7. Look for this setting information:
# Specify where the uploaded Microsoft Excel file will be saved to the
# system.
# NOTE: This must be a absolute path.
# NOTE: Django must have read/write access to this location.
BATCH_IMPORT_TEMPFILE_LOCATION = get_setting('BATCH_IMPORT_TEMPFILE_LOCATION', '/tmp/')

8. Change the default setting to one of your choosing (/tmp/ will work on most
linux boxes but this will fail on a Windows machine).

9. Go back to your sample_project folder and run syncdb (adding admin user):
   python manage.py syncdb

10. Start your django app:
    python manage.py runserver
