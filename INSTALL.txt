Thanks for downloading django-batchimport.

INSTALLATION:
1. Ensure that you have Python 2.5+ installed. 
See http://www.python.org for more information.

2. Ensure that you have Django 1.0+ installed.
See http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/install/ for more
information.

3. Install xlrd.
See http://www.lexicon.net/sjmachin/xlrd.htm for more
information.

4. In the same folder where you found this file is a sample_project folder.
Navigate to it.

5. Open the settings.py file. Change the following settings to your
liking:
   a. Templates folder location (look for "CHANGE_ME!!!" in settings.py).
   b. (Optional) Database type/location. I've got it set up to write 
      a Sqlite3 db to this folder and call it "sample_project.db".

6. Open the batchimport/batchimport_settings.py file.

7. Look for this setting information:
# Specify where the uploaded Microsoft Excel file will be saved to the
# system.
# NOTE: This must be a absolute path.
# NOTE: Django must have read/write access to this location.
BATCH_IMPORT_TEMPFILE_LOCATION = get_setting('BATCH_IMPORT_TEMPFILE_LOCATION', '/tmp/')

8. Change the default setting to one of your choosing (/tmp/ will work on most
linux boxes but this will fail on a Windows machine).

9. Go back to your sample_project folder and run syncdb (adding admin user):
   python manage.py syncdb

10. Start your django app:
    python manage.py runserver

TESTING:
11. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/batchimport/import_start/

12. Pick School from the model drop-down. 

13. Browse to the sample_data folder (in the same folder you found this 
document). Select the sample_school_data.xls file. Click Submit.

14. Leave the options alone for now. Select appropriate mappings from the
spreadsheet drop downs for each of the model fields. Leave the rest alone.
Click submit.

15. Wait some time (longer on Windows machines for some reason).

16. See the results of your batch import.

17. Go back to http://localhost:8000/batchimport/import_start/

18. Pick Teacher and use the fake_teacher_data.xls file instead. Click submit.

19. Match spreadsheet columns to model fields again. Leave the mapping to
School.name as is. Click submit.

20. Wait some time (again, longer on Windows machines for some reason).

21. See results.

22. Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ and log in.

23. Check out the Schools and Teachers you just imported.
